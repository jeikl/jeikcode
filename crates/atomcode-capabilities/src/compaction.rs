//! Cache-friendly history compaction — the v2 port of core's `collapse_committed`.
//!
//! Stubs OLD tool results in place (full output → a one-line summary), keeping the
//! ACTIVE turn full and exempting `read_file`. It is the POLICY only: the kernel owns
//! every invariant (sacred floor, net-loss guard, tool-call/result pairing repair,
//! `cache_epoch` bump, and turn-boundary-only triggering) in
//! [`Conversation::apply_plan`](atomcode_kernel::message::Conversation::apply_plan) plus
//! the task-boundary auto trigger. This strategy never mutates the conversation; it only
//! proposes a [`CompactionPlan`] of in-place rewrites.
//!
//! Why this is cache-friendly (the whole point — see core's
//! `2026-06-09-cache-friendly-compaction-design`): the stub is COMMITTED to history and
//! MONOTONIC. An already-stubbed result (`text.len() <= MIN_COLLAPSE_SIZE`) yields no
//! rewrite, so a re-run is a noop (the kernel's net-loss guard refuses it, epoch unchanged).
//! Each turn therefore breaks the provider prefix cache at most ONCE, at the TAIL (the
//! turn that just went stale), then freezes — instead of the old ephemeral `microcompact`
//! that re-derived stubs every render and flipped historical bytes full↔stub,炸 the
//! prefix repeatedly. Below the trigger threshold nothing is stubbed at all → short
//! sessions stay full-fidelity and purely append-only (perfect cache).
