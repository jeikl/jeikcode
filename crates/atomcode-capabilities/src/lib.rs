//! atomcode-capabilities — **L1 capabilities** layered on the neutral
//! `atomcode-kernel` (L0).
//!
//! # Layering rule (compile-enforced)
//!
//! This crate depends ONLY on `atomcode-kernel` (L0) + third-party crates. It must
//! NEVER depend on `atomcode-core` or any L2/L3 crate. That one-directional edge is
//! what keeps the kernel neutral: every *concrete* capability (a real provider, a
//! real tool, an MCP client, a skill loader) lives up here, never down in the
//! kernel. `cargo tree -p atomcode-capabilities` must not contain `atomcode-core`.
//!
//! # Capabilities are cargo-feature-gated
//!
//! A downstream embedder pulls in only what it needs, so e.g. a build that only
//! wants providers never compiles the (future) MCP/skills transitive deps:
//!   - `provider` (default): real [`LlmProvider`](atomcode_kernel::provider::LlmProvider)
//!     adapters — OpenAI-compatible (GLM / DeepSeek / …), Anthropic Messages (Claude),
//!     and Ollama native (`/api/chat`).
//!   - (future) `tools`, `mcp`, `skills`, `codeintel`.

// Redirect `ATOMCODE_HOME` to a throwaway temp dir before libtest spawns any thread,
// so the crate's own unit tests never persist sessions/config/memory into the
// developer's real `~/.atomcode`. Feature-independent (std + dev-deps only); kept at
// crate root so it is NOT inside a feature-gated module. Each `tests/*.rs` integration
// binary carries its own copy (separate binaries don't share this ctor).
