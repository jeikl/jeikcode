//! In-place binary upgrade for atomcode.
//!
//! Flow:
//! 1. Fetch `latest.json` manifest (version + per-target sha256/size).
//! 2. Detect current platform and pick the matching binary entry.
//! 3. Verify we can write to `current_exe()`'s directory — if not, fail
//!    with a precise message telling the user to re-run with `sudo`.
//! 4. Download the binary to a sibling temp file, streaming progress.
//! 5. Verify SHA256 against the manifest. Bail (and delete temp) on
//!    mismatch — we never touch the live binary until verification
//!    passes.
//! 6. Rename the live binary to `atomcode.bak` (Windows:
//!    `atomcode.exe.bak`), then rename the downloaded file into place.
//!    Same-directory rename is atomic on POSIX; on Windows, renaming
//!    the currently-running exe is allowed (deleting it is not).
//!
//! Rollback swaps the live binary with `.bak` in place, so one backup
//! always points to "the other version" — the user can toggle by
//! alternating `/upgrade` and `/upgrade rollback`.

//      restart just to pick up a new version. A background task can prepare
//      the staged binary while they work; apply happens whenever they do
//      restart (which they will, eventually, for unrelated reasons).
//   2. Users whose sessions are short but who rarely think to run
//      `/upgrade` — same benefit: the next normal launch carries the bump.
//
// Flow:
//   session N      : prepare_deferred_upgrade()
//                    → download to ~/.atomcode/staged/<filename>
//                    → write ~/.atomcode/staged/pending.json
//                    → (UI surfaces "⟲ vX.Y.Z pending")
//   session N exit : no special work; staged files survive any exit path
//                    (graceful, SIGHUP on terminal close, SIGKILL, power
//                    loss — all fine, state is on disk)
//   session N+1    : apply_pending_upgrade() runs BEFORE tokio starts
//                    → atomically swaps live binary with staged
//                    → re-execs self with original argv
//                    → user sees "✓ Upgraded to vX.Y.Z" on welcome
