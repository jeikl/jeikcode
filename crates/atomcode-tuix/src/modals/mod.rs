// crates/atomcode-tuix/src/modals/mod.rs
//
// Modal overlay abstraction. Each of the three existing overlays
// (`/model` picker, `/provider` wizard, `/resume` session picker)
// implements `Modal`, and the event loop owns exactly one
// `active_modal: Option<Box<dyn Modal>>`. Adding a fourth modal means
// "new struct + new impl" — not another `Option<T>` field and another
// `handle_X_key` fn and another branch in `handle_input`.
//
// Modal impl lives next to the struct definition (for now still in
// `event_loop.rs`; Step 5 will move each modal to its own file under
// `crates/atomcode-tuix/src/modals/`). This module only defines the
// trait + action enum.
